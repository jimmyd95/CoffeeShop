Got some [coffee beans](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/coffee-beans-visualsfm-e6afbb3278ce4ab48b8316f1c1444cc1) samples from [John Fino (tauricity)](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/moccamaster-coffee-machine-rigged-low-poly-ace7c1d271a3434b851bd55c298cc23d), Coffee Beans - VisualSFM.

A [Coffee Machine](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/moccamaster-coffee-machine-rigged-low-poly-ace7c1d271a3434b851bd55c298cc23d) from [Rookstun](https://sketchfab.com/Rookstun). Implemented colliders so users can break up individual parts of the machine.

I also tried to implement the [coffee bean](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/coffee-bean-9cae5abb7c2e4e57a405579fa6922672) from the [Digital Archive of Natural History (DiNArDa)](https://sketchfab.com/disc3d) but the file size was enormousâ€¦

[Coffee bag](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/coffee-packet-10c473aca9f1483499f52d86c3c24323) from [3dDan](https://sketchfab.com/kellettupholstery). Included a mesh collider so the user can grab the bag.

Got [Coffee Bernini](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/caffe-bernini-30aec62d7c7f4c58acac204d2eeb49bd) from [Jellepostma](https://sketchfab.com/Jellepostma). Included box/mesh/sphere colliders for some of the walls, and floors to ensure users can walk around it.

Imported [Coffee Beans](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/coffee-bean-a7e9fc310f9b4fd3aac55f31bf9d6126) from [Azamuki](https://sketchfab.com/Azamuki). It was very small and compacted, which made the size a lot easier to render.

Found a [cup](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/coffee-cup-coffee-cup-c09d2cb98bce444e92857381676f7f44) from mattmccabe1.

Imported the old Sushi shop set into the scene, which is nice.

Next iteration will probably focus on detailing the palm menu for more features, i.e. auto roasting the coffee beans, generating coffee beans, machine and item interaction animation, etc
